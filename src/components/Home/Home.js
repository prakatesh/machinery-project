              It is imperative that your generator be serviced on a regular
              basis to ensure that it is capable of starting in the event of a
              power outage. Your investment in a generator is only justified if
              its starts and provides power when required so there is no
              interruption to the running of your organisation.

              There are 3 key preventative maintenance services that address the
              most common reasons why your generator wonâ€™t start, to ensure our
              valued clients are not wasting their money with unnecessary
              maintenance costs.

              The benefit of a generator is wasted if it fails to start because
              of a simple battery failure or blown fuse and these are more
              common occurrences than people would assume.

              The price of a scheduled maintenance program is small in
              comparison to the cost to your organisation of a generator that
              lets you down when the power goes out.
