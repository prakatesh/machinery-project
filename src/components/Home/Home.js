                It is imperative that your generator be serviced on a regular
                basis to ensure that it is capable of starting in the event of a
                power outage. Your investment in a generator is only justified
                if its starts and provides power when required so there is no
                interruption to the running of your organisation.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are 3 key preventative maintenance services that address
                the most common reasons why your generator wonâ€™t start, to
                ensure our valued clients are not wasting their money with
                unnecessary maintenance costs.

                The benefit of a generator is wasted if it fails to start
                because of a simple battery failure or blown fuse and these are
                more common occurrences than people would assume.

              <p>Through our experience with clients, it has been found that on average a generator is actually called to operate about once a year. Even though the generator is not used regularly, there are potential issues with the generator not performing when your organisation needs it most</p>
              <p>Servicing covers the majority of the potential issues of a generator not starting however to ensure your generator is 100% reliable there is one important service recommendation which is to complete a mains failure test.</p>
